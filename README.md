# Anomaly_LSTM_Time_series
nomaly provides evidence that actual results differ from predicted results based on ML models. We are talking about price prediction and how ML model is behaving compared to actual price data. Here anomaly is defined as a point in time where the behavior of the system is unusual and significantly different from past behavior. So, going by this definition, an anomaly does not necessarily imply a problem. An important use case is the ability to detect anomalies by analyzing and learning the time series. That means AI can be used to detect anomalous data points in the time series by understanding the trends and changes seen from historical data.
